## Exploring the Exploit Database

Upon landing on the Exploit Database main page, you'll find exploits listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent postings at the top.

The default Exploits page displays key information across several columns:

- **Date**: Entries are sorted with the newest exploits at the top.
- **D/Download Exploit**: Click here to download the exploit file.
- **A/Vulnerable Application**: If available and permissible, this column links to the vulnerable software.
- **V/Verified**: A checkmark indicates verified exploits; an X signifies unverified. Non-working items are removed.
- **Title**: Provides a brief overview of the target software and exploit type.
- **Type**: Specifies the exploit category, such as DOS, Local, Remote, or WebApp.
- **Platform**: Shows the affected operating systems or platforms.
- **Author**: Credits the individual or group who published the exploit.

One of the most valuable features of the Exploit Database is the ability to download the source code for the exploits, a unique aspect that sets it apart from other exploit information sources.

## Caution

While it might be tempting to visit sites found through Google dorks, exercise caution. These sites might host or be associated with malicious content. Always conduct such investigations from a secure environment, like a VM that can be easily restored to a safe state.
